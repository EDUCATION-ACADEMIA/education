<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-According to Gandhi ‘Ahimsa or Non-Violence’ is the means; Truth is the end. They are so intertwined that it is impossible to separate them. They are the two sides of a coin.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Gandhi says: It is perhaps clear from the foregoing, that without ahimsa it is not possible to seek and find Truth. Ahimsa and Truth are so intertwined that it is practically impossible to disentangle and separate them. They are like the two sides of a coin, or rather of a smooth unstamped metallic disk.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-. “Truth” or “Satya” and “Ahimsa” or “Non-Violence” are the foundations of Gandhian philosophy. They were two socio-political weapons he used in achieving his goals.

</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Gandhi said, “Truth is not only Relative Truth of our conception but the Absolute Truth, the Eternal Principle, that is God.” Thus, while Absolute Truth is God, the Relative Truth is something what we perceive as Truth. No proof is required to know the Absolute Truth because it is eternal and infinite.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Gandhi understood nonviolence from its Sanskrit root “Ahimsa". Ahimsa is just translated to mean nonviolence in English, but it implies more than just avoidance of physical violence.
