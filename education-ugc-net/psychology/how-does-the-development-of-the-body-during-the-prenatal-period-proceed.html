<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The neural tube begins to form along with an area known as the neural plate. The earliest signs of development of the neural tube are the emergence of two ridges that form along each side of the neural plate. Around the fourth week, the head begins to form, quickly followed by the eyes, nose, ears, and mouth.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-From beginning as a one-cell structure to your birth, your prenatal development occurred in an orderly and delicate sequence. There are three stages of prenatal development: germinal, embryonic, and fetal. Keep in mind that this is different than the three trimesters of pregnancy.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The fetal brain begins to develop during the third week of gestation. Neural progenitor cells begin to divide and differentiate into neurons and glia, the two cell types that form the basis of the nervous system. By the ninth week, the brain appears as a small, smooth structure.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The first organ system to develop during organogenesis is the cardiovascular system. The heart has established its four chambers by four weeks of development, whereas week six involves cardiac outflow separation and descent of the heart (and lungs) into the thorax.
