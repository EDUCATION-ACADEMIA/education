<strong>Concept note-1:

If left in the same environment, over time they become accustomed to their surroundings and pay less attention to them. This process is called habituation. However, the moment something new happens, infants are ready to pay attention again.

<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-For example, an infant may gaze upon a visual stimulus that has been presented to him for 1 minute. After habituation to that stimulus, the observer will determine the amount of time the infant spends in looking at a new stimulus.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Fantz developed an innovative approach to the evaluation of perception in infants based on the principle of visual selectivity (Fantz, 1956). He surmised that if the infant looked longer at one stimulus than another, they must be able to perceive a difference between the two.
</p>

<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Habituation refers to the decreased responsiveness toward a stimulus after it has been presented numerous times in succession.
