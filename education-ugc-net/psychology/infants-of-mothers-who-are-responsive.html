<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A responsive parent is attuned to their child’s emotions and reacts to their cues promptly in ways that are supportive and developmentally appropriate. What is this? To infants and very young children, that’s all there is to it. Babies need your attentive care.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:

</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Touch becomes an early language as babies respond to skin-to-skin contact. It’s soothing for both you and your baby while promoting your baby’s healthy growth and development. Eye-to-eye contact provides meaningful communication at close range. Babies can follow moving objects with their eyes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-They undergo huge brain development, growth and neuron pruning in the first two years of life. The brain development of infants (as well as their social, emotional and cognitive development) depends on a loving bond or attachment relationship with a primary caregiver, usually a parent.
