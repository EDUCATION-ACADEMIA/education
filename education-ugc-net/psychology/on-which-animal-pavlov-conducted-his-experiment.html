While the dogs were being fed, he used a small test tube to measure the saliva by inserting it into their cheeks.Classical conditioning was first studied in detail by Ivan Pavlov, who conducted experiments with dogs and published his findings in 1897. During the Russian physiologists study of digestion, Pavlov observed that the dogs serving as his subjects drooled when they were being served meat.Experiment Summary Classical conditioning is learning through association and was first demonstrated by Ivan Pavlov.

He didnt go for a specific breed, but instead seems to have used all sorts of dogs, many of them mutts.To do that, he developed a system of sham feeding. Pavlov would remove a dogs esophagus and create an opening, a fistula, in the animals throat, so that, no matter how much the dog ate, the food would fall out and never make it to the stomach.">
