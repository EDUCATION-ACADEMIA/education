<meta name="description" content="Classical conditioning refers to learning that occurs when a neutral stimulus (e.g., a tone) becomes associated with a stimulus (e.g., food) that naturally produces a behaviour. After the association is learned, the previously neutral stimulus is sufficient to produce the behaviour.Teachers can apply classical conditioning in the class by creating a positive classroom environment to help students overcome anxiety or fear. Pairing an anxiety-provoking situation, such as performing in front of a group, with pleasant surroundings helps the student learn new associations.Classical conditioning involves associating an involuntary response and a stimulus, while operant conditioning is about associating a voluntary behavior and a consequence. In operant conditioning, the learner is also rewarded with incentives, 5﻿ while classical conditioning involves no such enticements.When teaching reading for example, a teacher can apply this theory by providing repeated or drilled exercises. For example, if the teacher wants to teach fluency of KV + KVK syllables, teacher could ask the pupils to repeat those syllables multiple times till they can pronounce it correctly.">

<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Classical conditioning involves associating an involuntary response and a stimulus, while operant conditioning is about associating a voluntary behavior and a consequence.
